# IEC-printer

As of now, the only thing working in this folder is run_vice_print.sh. Pass in the filename to raw printer data, e.g. print.dump out of Vice, and this script will call Vice and convert the raw data to BMP images for printing. If you want the script to actually print, make sure the lpr command is uncommented.
