# IEC-printer
Connects a thermal printer to vintage Commodore computers using the IEC bus. It has the C64 font and PC font and can print upto 48 chars/line.

# Info
Most of the IEC routines borowed from https://github.com/Larswad/uno2iec . Many thanks for solving the gory details of the IEC and kept me focussing at the printercode.
