# IEC-printer

Forked from https://github.com/smdprutser/IEC-printer.

Once working this Arduino sketch will send raw print data to a Raspberry PI for printing to a USB printer. This is currently NOT WORKING for this use case.

# Info
Most of the IEC routines borowed from https://github.com/Larswad/uno2iec . Many thanks for solving the gory details of the IEC and kept me focussing at the printercode.
